## What's up?

I'm Bruno, a Software Engineer with long time experience in Front-End development.

Currently I work full-time at [@tonolucro](https://github.com/tonolucro).

I like to help the community here at GitHub... I'm keeping a very nice project called [SetRobot](https://github.com/3runoDesign/setRobot) a theme for WP.
